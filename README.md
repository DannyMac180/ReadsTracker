# ReadsTracker
Search and keep lists of the books you want to read, are reading and have finished reading.

ReadsTracker is an app that allows you to search the Google Books API and add a book to one of three lists:

1. To Read
2. Reading
3. Finished

To search for a book, click on the “search” tab and enter an author name or book title to find the book you’re looking for. Once you’ve found it, click on the book and press the button at the bottom corresponding to the list you want to add it to.

The button farthest to the left is “To Read”. The middle button is “reading”. The button farthest to the right is “finished”.

ReadsTracker was created by Danny McAteer with the help of the stellar team at Udacity. You can contact Danny at mcateerd2@gmail.com with bug reports or feature suggestions. Happy reading!
